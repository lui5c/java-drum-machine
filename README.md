# java-drum-machine

A very simple, polyrhythm-oriented drum machine. Each sample's sequence is programmed individually and repeats at the end of the sequence. 

Sequences are programmed entirely in quarter-note rests and quarter notes. If you want a complicated sequence with eighth or sixteenth note rests, you have to use a higher BPM and adjust the sequence accordingly. 

For example, a half-time classic rock pattern would be written:

hat:    x
snare:  ooxo
kick:   xooo

x is a note, o is a rest. The hat plays every beat (1-note pattern). The kick plays on the 1 and the snare plays on the 3.
