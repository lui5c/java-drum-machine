# java-drum-machine

A very simple, polyrhythm-oriented drum machine. Each sample's sequence is programmed individually and repeats at the end of the sequence. 

Sequences are programmed entirely in quarter-note rests and quarter notes. If you want a complicated sequence with eighth or sixteenth note rests, you have to use a higher BPM and adjust the sequence accordingly. 

For example, a classic rock pattern would be written:

hat:    x
snare:  ox
kick:   xo

The hat plays every beat (1-note pattern). The kick plays on odd beats and the snare plays on even beats.
